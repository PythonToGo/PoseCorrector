# Pose Corrector Project

The Pose Corrector project aims to create an application that monitors the user's posture through a webcam while using a computer. By detecting improper postures, it alerts the user to encourage a healthier working environment. This initiative supports maintaining a healthier posture during prolonged periods of computer usage.

## Prerequisites

- Webcam
- Python installed on your system
- Required Libraries: OpenCV, Dlib, TensorFlow, etc.
- Posture recognition model (e.g., Pre-trained pose estimation model using TensorFlow Lite)

## Development Steps

### 1. Environment Setup and Library Installation

Install the necessary Python libraries. OpenCV is used for video stream processing, and TensorFlow is employed for machine learning models.

### 2. Capturing Video Stream from Webcam

Utilize Python and OpenCV to capture real-time video streams from the webcam. `cv2.VideoCapture` is used to read the video stream from the webcam.

### 3. Integrating Posture Recognition Model

Incorporate a lightweight machine learning library such as TensorFlow Lite with a pre-trained pose estimation model. The model analyzes the user's posture in real-time to detect specific postures (e.g., slouched back, uneven shoulders).

### 4. Posture Analysis and Assessment

Analyze captured posture data and compare it with defined healthy posture standards. If an improper posture is detected, provide an alert to the user. For example, the user can be encouraged to stretch or correct their posture.

### 5. Developing User Interface (UI)

Develop a simple user interface to display the application's status and allow for user input. The UI can show posture analysis results, tips for maintaining a healthy posture, and the user's posture improvement progress.

### 6. Testing and Optimization

Test the application with various users and environments to verify accuracy and responsiveness. If necessary, perform additional tuning to improve the posture recognition algorithm's accuracy.

### 7. Collecting and Reflecting User Feedback

Collect feedback from actual users and use it to improve the application. For instance, adding detection capabilities for a wider variety of postures or enhancing user experience.

## Conclusion

The Pose Corrector project is a step towards fostering healthier work habits by leveraging technology to monitor and improve posture. Through continuous development and user feedback, it aims to become an essential tool for anyone spending significant time in front of a computer.
